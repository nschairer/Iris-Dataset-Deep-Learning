# Iris-Dataset-Deep-Learning
Neural network examples that classify the iris dataset with around 3% loss. Inspired originally by this medium post: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6

It is completley coded from scratch other than using numpy for linear algebra calculations. The onelayer file contains a neural network with one hidden layer and the twolayer file contains a neural network with two hidden layers.
